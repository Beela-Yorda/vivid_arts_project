This is a hand-on cloud engineering project delivered by the azubi africa cloud team in 2023. After 6 months of AWS cloud training and front-end development, we got a chance to work on some realife cloud projects. I was able to work with:

Project Overview
   Todo and technologies
1. Use AWS s3 (cloud storage service)
2. Upload your files to AWS s3
3. Launch a sample webapp
   1. Creating an s3 bucket through the AWS console
You need to have a an AWS account, you can get a freetire account which basically means you get a free 1 year to use some AWS resources. In our case, we have that setup and we will be using the s3 service.

Go to the s3 service
click on "create bucket" : a bucket is where we will put our files.
click on "objects" : obejects are files that can go into the bucket.
   2. Setup Website hosting for S3
Webhosting is what allows o a webfile to be served to the internet. AWS offers a free option to host a static website (static is something that doesnt use data from a database).

Go to your s3 bucket
Go to the properties tab
Scroll down to Static Web Hosting and enable this.
   3. Launch your website on s3
We have a bucket and its now hosting ready, all we need to do is add our files and we can access the site.

Go to your s3 bucket and upload "objects". these are your webfiles from your computer
Go to the s3 bucket properties tab
Scroll down to Static Web Hosting and you should now see a url. *click on the url and access your site.
